# Bot-population
This is the bot population I made as an example following Code-Bullet's tutorial (at first).

After finishing the tutorial, I changed systems in which I wanted to recreate such as the whole fitness system which now uses a genepool (As of 21/05/18). I have also added obstacles which the bots have to avoid.
